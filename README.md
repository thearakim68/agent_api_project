Here's a professional and human-written `README.md` tailored to your current `agent_api_project` setup, in Kim Theara's personal tone:

# 🤖 Multi-Agent API Project – Real-World Tools with Agentic AI

This project showcases how to build AI assistants that **use real-world tools** like Google Search, Weather APIs, and Calendar management.

It’s a step up from simple prompt-based bots. These agents don’t just answer — they take action by **calling real APIs**, parsing results, and responding with helpful context.

> Built with Python, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT — for serious experimentation in Agentic AI.

---

## ✨ What It Does

The main script `multi_agent.py` demonstrates:
- **Search Agent** – fetches live search results from the web
- **Weather Agent** – pulls live weather for any location via OpenWeatherMap
- **Calendar Agent** – adds and announces events (mock calendar)

Each agent runs as a separate tool and can be independently expanded.

## 🔑 Environment Setup

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:thearakim68/agent_api_project.git
cd agent_api_project
````

2. Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key_here
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python multi_agent.py
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
Search results: 3 interesting headlines about the Cambodia economy in 2025.
Weather info: Mostly sunny in Phnom Penh, 33°C. Feels like 36°C.
Event: Event 'UX Workshop' scheduled for 2025-10-27 10:00 AM.
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11+**
* **LangChain** – Agent orchestration
* **OpenAI GPT-4**
* **OpenWeatherMap API**
* **DuckDuckGo API or Google Search API**

---

## 💡 Ideas for Future Work

* Connect to **real Google Calendar**
* Add **voice input/output**
* Expand search to use vector databases (e.g., RAG)
* Use **Tool Calling API** with OpenAI Functions
